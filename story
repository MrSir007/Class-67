Once upon a time, in a forest, there lives a monkey in a tree. In the same forest, there lives a crocodile and his wife.

One day, the crocodile came to the backs of the river and rested under the tree.The kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits and the crocodile loves them. Thiskept happening for days.
